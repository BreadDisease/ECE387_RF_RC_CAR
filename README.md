# ECE387_RF_RC_CAR

For this project, Jordan Smith and I (Aidan Quimby) will be creating an RC car. The car will be controlled by an RF remote using buttons with a battery to make the remote portable. If we need to, we can add additional features such as: a catapult attached to the front controlled by a servo motor and a button on the remote, an auto stop feature using an ultrasonic sensor to make sure the car doesnâ€™t run head first into a wall, or maybe even some kind of pathfinding assistance if we can make it work.
